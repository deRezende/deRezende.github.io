    <h1>Postdoc Position in Theoretical Computer Science</h1>

    <p>
    The Department of Computer Science at LTH, Lund University invites applications 
    for a postdoc position in theoretical computer science.
    </p>
   
    
    
    <h3>Job description</h3> 
     
    
    <p>
    We are looking for excellent candidates interested
    in strengthening the <a href="https://derezende.github.io/team.html">research group</a>
    in complexity theory headed by Susanna de Rezende. 
    
    </p>
    
    <p>  
    This position is a full-time research position for an expected duration of two years.

    The starting date is negotiable but should ideally be during the autumn of 2024.

    This is a fully funded, employed position (including travel money) 
    that come with an internationally very competitive salary.

    <h3>Workplace</h3>     
    
  <p>

  Lund University was founded in 1666 and is repeatedly ranked among the
  top 100 universities in the world. Lund Technical College (LTH) forms
  the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University, where research of
  the highest international standard is conducted.
  </p>

  
  <p>  
  The
  <a href="http://cs.lth.se/english/">Department of Computer Science</a>
  at LTH is a partner in the
  <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/">Wallenberg AI,
    Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)</a>,
  which is Sweden's largest ever individual research program and
  addresses research on artificial intelligence broadly construed,
  and also in the
  <a href="https://elliit.se/?l=en">ELLIIT Excellence Centre</a>
  focused on basic and applied research in information technologies.
  </p>

    <h3>Scientific Environment</h3> 
    
    <p>
    There is a growing research group in algorithms and complexity theory at 
    Lund University. We expect to have 8 PhD students by the autumn, in addition to 
    three faculty, a postdoc and some MSc students working in foundations of computer science.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Lund University is located in the Öresund area, which is 
    offering one of the strongest and most exciting environments 
    in computational complexity research in Europe.
    
    <!--    Located at less than an hour from Copenhagen, -->
    There is extensive collaboration with the University of Copenhagen (UCPH), 
    the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU), and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
    on the other side of the Öresund Bridge.
    In particular, we will be collaborating with the 
    <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/miao-group/">MIAO research group</a>, 
    which is active at both Lund University and the University of Copenhagen. 
    The PhD students can also look forward to interacting with the four additional 
    faculty in complexity theory in Copenhagen, together with their students and 
    postdocs, as well as with the algorithms group at the 
    <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre</a>.
    </p>
    
  
    <h3>Qualifications</h3>  
    
  <p>
  To be eligible to apply for this position, applicants need to have
  or be close to obtaining a PhD degree in a subject relevant 
  for the research area.
  The successful candidates are expected to have a solid background and
  passionate interest in computer science and mathematics, and should 
  have a strong research record as witnessed by publications in top 
  conferences or journals.

  </p>
  
  <p>  
  The working language of the group is English, and knowledge of
  English is also fully sufficient to navigate
  every-day life
  in Scandinavia
  in general.
