    <h3>Job description</h3> 
     
    
    <p>
    We are looking for excellent candidates interested
    in strengthening the <a href="https://derezende.github.io/team.html">research group</a>
    in complexity theory headed by Susanna de Rezende. 
    
    </p>
    
    <p>  
    This position is a full-time research position for an expected duration of two years.

There is a growing research group in foundations of computer science at 
Lund University. We expect to have 8 PhD students by the autumn, 
in addition to three faculty and two postdocs. Our group's research 
spans various facets of complexity theory, encompassing both 
combinatorial and logical perspectives. 
Key areas of interest include proof complexity, circuit complexity, 
communication complexity, meta-complexity, and their connections to algorithms.
    </p>
    <p> 
Lund University is located in the Öresund area, which is offering one 
of the strongest and most exciting environments in computational 
complexity research in Europe. 
There is extensive collaboration with the University of Copenhagen (UCPH),
