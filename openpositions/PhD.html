    <h1>Two PhD Positions in Theoretical Computer Science</h1>

    <p>
    The Department of Computer Science at LTH, Lund University invites applications 
    for two PhD positions in theoretical computer science.
    </p>
   
    
    
    <h3>Job description</h3> 
     
    
    <p>
    The PhD students will be working in the research group of Susanna de Rezende, 
    where the focus is on computational complexity and algorithms. 
    <!--We are looking for excellent candidates interested in conducting 
    research in computational complexity and algorithms. -->
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
    At the heart of computational complexity is the quest to 
    understand the nature of efficient computation. 
    What makes a problem computationally hard or easy? 
    How can we show that every algorithm that solves a certain problem 
    must necessarily consume a large amount of resources 
    (such as time or memory, say)? 
    The study of the potential and limits of efficient computation is 
    about foundational, mathematical, research, but research results 
    in computational complexity theory have had major impact in other 
    areas of computer science and other scientific disciplines,
    and have given rise to some of the most important open problems 
    in modern mathematics.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There is quite some flexibility as to what research the PhD students will pursue.
    A potential research project is to explore connections between proof complexity
    and circuit complexity.
    Exciting new, and unexpected, relations between circuits and proofs have already had a 
    transformative impact in both areas. Some of these appeared already in the late 90s, 
    but the last few years has seen an impressive revival. 
    There are many reasons to believe that we have only scratched the surface of promising
    approaches that will yield important insights on existing open problems.
    </p>
    
    <p>  
    These are four-year full-time employed positions,
    but PhD positions usually (though not necessarily) include 20% teaching, in which case
    they are prolonged for one more year.

    The starting date is negotiable but should ideally be as early as
    possible during the autumn of 2022.

    The positions are fully funded, employed positions (including travel money) 
    that come with an internationally very competitive salary.
    </p>
 
 
      
    
    <h3>Work place</h3>     
    
  <p>

  Lund University was founded in 1666 and is repeatedly ranked among the
  top 100 universities in the world. Lund Technical College (LTH) forms
  the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University, where research of
  the highest international standard is conducted.
  </p>

  
  <p>  
  The
  <a href="http://cs.lth.se/english/">Department of Computer Science</a>
  at LTH is a partner in the
  <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/">Wallenberg AI,
    Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)</a>,
  which is Sweden's largest ever individual research program and
  addresses research on artificial intelligence broadly construed,
  and also in the
  <a href="https://elliit.se/?l=en">ELLIIT Excellence Centre</a>
  focused on basic and applied research in information technologies.
  </p>

    <h3>Scientific Environment</h3> 
    
    <p>
    There is a growing research group in algorithms and complexity theory at 
    Lund University. We expect to have four PhD students by the autumn, in addition to 
    two faculty and some MSc students working in the computational complexity.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Lund University is located in the Öresund area, which is 
    offering one of the strongest and most exciting environments 
    in computational complexity research in Europe.
    
    <!--    Located at less than an hour from Copenhagen, -->
    There is extensive collaborations with the University of Copenhagen (UCPH), 
    the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU), and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
    on the other side of the Öresund Bridge.
    In particular, we will be collaborating with the 
    <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/miao-group/">MIAO research group</a>, 
    which is active at both Lund University and the University of Copenhagen. 
    The PhD students can also look forward to interacting with the five additional 
    faculty in complexity theory in Copenhagen, together with their students and 
    postdocs, as well as with the algorithms group at the 
    <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre</a>.
    </p>
    
  
    <h3>Qualifications</h3>  
    
  <p>
  To be eligible to apply for this position, applicants need to have
  or be close to obtaining either an MSc degree or a 4-year BSc
  degree. A suitable background is, for instance, a degree in computer
  science, mathematics, electrical engineering, or possibly
  technical physics with a theoretical specialization.
  </p>
  
    
  <p>
  The successful candidate is expected to have a strong background and
  passionate interest in computer science and mathematics.

  Problem solving skills and creativity are essential.

  </p>
  
  <p>  
  The working language of the group is English, and knowledge of
  English is also fully sufficient to navigate
  every-day life
  in Scandinavia
  in general. 
  </p>
