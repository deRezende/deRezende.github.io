    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p>
The area of proof complexity was introduced by Cook and Reckhow in 1979 as a way to tackle the NP vs coNP problem. The overarching goal of the field is to understand how difficult it is to prove certain mathematical facts. Traditionally, the complexity of a theorem is measured as the length of the shortest proof of the theorem in a given formal system. Since the early years of the field many techniques have been developed to analyze concrete proof systems, including establishing relations to other areas of complexity. 
    </p>

    <p>
In recent years, many exciting results and new connections to proof complexity were discovered or further developed in areas such as, for example, automated proof search, combinatorial optimization, total NP search problems (TFNP), minimum circuit size problem (MCSP), cryptography, learning, approximation algorithms and sum-of-squares, extension complexity, algebraic complexity and witnessing theorems. The goal of this workshop is to present some of the classical theory in proof complexity, as well as survey some of the recent exciting connections.
    The talks will be tutorial in style and we especially encourage attendance from people working in related areas who are not familiar with proof complexity. 
    </p>

The workshop is virtual and will take place over Zoom. <a href="https://focs2021.cs.colorado.edu/registration/">FOCS registration is required for all participants.</a> The Zoom link will be made available to registered participants.

<div id="neil"><strong>Neil Thapen: A logical approach to TFNP</strong></div>

<p>
TFNP search problems have the form: find a witness to an NP property of
some object, when a witness is always known to exist. For example, given
a hash function from n+1 bits to n bits, find a collision.
</p>

<p>
Subclasses of TFNP are usually defined by specifying a problem and
including all problems reducible to it. It turns out that this is
essentially the same as specifying a logical theory and including all
problems which the theory proves have a solution. I will talk about what
TFNP looks like from this point of view.
</p>

<p>
Essentially any theory can be used. Some useful ones come from bounded
arithmetic, where questions about the provability of some relevant
combinatorial principles have been well studied. I will say what the
corresponding subclasses of TFNP look like; in particular we get
subclasses capturing the strength of some standard models of
computation. I will use this approach to study the place of the RAMSEY
search problem in TFNP, via a theory that captures reasoning using
approximate counting.
</p>

<div id="jan"><strong>Jan Krajíček: What do tautologies know about their proofs?</strong></div>

<p>
A recently discovered new proof complexity measure
based on algorithmic information seems to play as
a fundamental role for proof search as the size
measure plays for classical proof complexity centered 
around lengths-of-proofs notions and problems.
</p>
<p>
 One cannot hope to separate unconditionally, for any 
proof system, the information measure from (the log of) 
the size measure as that would imply that P differs from NP.
</p>
<p> 
 But is it possible to prove non-trivial lower bounds for 
information in some cases where we failed so far to prove 
size lower bounds? 
</p>
<p>
 This problem seems to be quite inspiring and possibly runs 
rather deep. I shall explain the necessary background and 
discuss several facets of the problem.
